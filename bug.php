This code suffers from a subtle issue related to PHP's type juggling and the behavior of the `==` operator.  When comparing a string '0' with a numerical 0, PHP's loose comparison (`==`) considers them equal. This can lead to unexpected results if you rely on strict type checking.

```php
$stringZero = '0';
$numericalZero = 0;

if ($stringZero == $numericalZero) {
  echo "These are equal (using loose comparison)";
}

if ($stringZero === $numericalZero) {
  echo "These are equal (using strict comparison)";
} else {
  echo "These are NOT equal (using strict comparison)";
}
```
